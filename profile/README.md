## Welcome to the DARC side! ðŸ‘‹

At the Data and Research Center (DARC), we deliver expert-driven, flexible research and data solutions tailored to your investigative needs. Powered by [OpenAleph](https://openaleph.org/), our versatile open-source search tool, we ensure fast, efficient, and precise investigations, giving you the reliability of an in-house team with the flexibility of an on-demand service.

This organization page will be updated soon. In the meantime, take a look at previous work we did at our predecessor Github organization [investigativedata](https://github.com/investigativedata).
